  i) Memorising ( Instance Based Learning )
 ii) Generalising (understanding concept) ( Model Based Learning )


==> Instance Based Learning (Lazy learner):--

- taking out distance between the nearest data already there to the new output, based on that deciding the output.
- Think “memorize and compare”.
- The system remembers all examples it has seen. When it sees something new, it compares it to what it knows and predicts based on the closest match.
- Storage heavy as everytime we need the training data. 

- Example:
You meet a new animal and try to guess if it’s a dog. You think, “Hmm, it looks like the dogs I’ve seen before,” and decide it’s a dog.

- Key idea: No rules or formulas are learned, just stored examples.
- Common algorithms: RBF, Kernel, KNN.

==> Model Based Learning:--
- Think “learn rules and patterns”.
- The system creates a model (like a formula or map) from the examples it sees. When it sees something new, it uses the model to make predictions.

- Example:
You learn that “animals with four legs, fur, and bark sound = dog.”

Next time you see an animal, you check these rules to decide if it’s a dog.
- Key idea: The system generalizes and doesn’t need to remember every example.
- Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks.
