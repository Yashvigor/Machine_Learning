==> Batch(Offline) Machine Learning:
- utilizing whole data together for training ML model on offline system and then deploy on server.
- but when new techniques and updation are added but system doesn't remain up-to-date so it needs retraining of the model.
- merging the data with new updation and test it and then put it on server periodically.

Disadvantage
i) Lots of Data: for large data as when we put whole data together, existing tools may not process
ii) Hardware Limitation: frequent updates is not possible when connectivity is not good, so it fails.
iii) Availability


==> Online Machine Learning:
- using technique, dynamically model is learning and improving  with new data, training is incremental sequentially. 
- training dynamically while on server. 

Libraries: River, Vowpal Wabbit (Reinforcement Learning)

-> Learning Rate: How frequently model is trained such thar remembering old data and adding new as per required to improve model. 
-> Out of core Learning: data is so huge so it cant be loaded once in memory so training that way is dfficult so data is divided into mini batches.

Disadvantage :
i) Tricky to use 
ii) Risky: can't make open to learn from new data blindly biased towards incoming data.
