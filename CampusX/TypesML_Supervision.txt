1) Supervised ML:
- In one dataset both input and output are given, finding relationship between input and output so when new input is given, we can identify output for new input.

  i) Regression:
  - target is numerical.

  ii) Classification:
  - Yes or No type 

2) Unsupervised ML:
- Only input is given. 
   i) Clustering
   - grouping similar type of data and categorizing them even for high dimensions.
  ii) Dimensionality reduction
   - remove extra columns and do feature extraction
   - for multiple dimensions, for visualization reduce the dimensions for plotting a graph for the data
 iii) Anamoly Reduction
   - detecting outliers 
  iv) Association Rule Learning
   - data fetch and drawing conclusions

3) Semi-Supervised ML:
- no need to label all the data or doesn't have the data. labelling few data and other unlabelled data are automatically labelled. eg. Google photos categorizing   based on face

4) Reinforcement ML:
- Algorithm is known as agent and that agent trains the data such that giving rewards when the info goes right and punishing when wrong.
